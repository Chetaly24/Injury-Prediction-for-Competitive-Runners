# Injury-Prediction-for-Competitive-Runners

Running is a great form of exercise, recreation, and sport participation for adults, adolescents, and children. Whether alone or in a team environment, running, when done properly, can enhance physical fitness, coordination, sense of accomplishment, and physical and emotional development. However, running under adverse conditions or with inadequate clothing and equipment can cause a variety of injuries and physical stress.


The data set consists of a detailed training log from a Dutch high-level running team over a period of seven years (2012-2019). We included the middle and long-distance runners of the team, that is, those competing on distances between the 800 meters and the marathon. This design decision is motivated by the fact that these groups have strong endurance-based components in their training, making their training regimes comparable. The head coach of the team did not change during the years of data collection.

The data set contains samples from 74 runners, of whom 27 are women and 47 are men. At the moment of data collection, they had been in the team for an average of 3.7 years. Most athletes competed on a national level, and some also on an international level. The study was conducted according to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the second authorâ€™s institution.

One of the most popular sports in the world is running. In America alone, 60 million individuals engaged in jogging, running, or trail running in 2017. However, it is said that 50% of runners suffer an injury each year. Running enthusiasts take several efforts to reduce the risk of injuries because recovering from them may be a difficult and drawn-out process. These safety measures include, among others, purchasing rollers, massages, and expert guidance. Although many individuals cannot afford the investments required for these resources. Many individuals are unsure whether machine learning will be able to lower the barrier for injury prediction resources given the developments in data science. In our analysis we will see how popular machine learning algorithms deal with predicting injuries using running data.
